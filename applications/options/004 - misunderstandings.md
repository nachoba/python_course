## Chapter 3 - Misunderstanding Regarding Options

Options are misunderstood instruments in that they are often mischaracterized as being risky even by the most experienced investors. You can use options, particularly covered calls, to generate a safe return for yourself without exposing your account to additional risk.

Some investors, instead of looking to generate cash flow, they seek more complicated ways of hedging their investments by investing in gold and silver. Some even stray into alternative assets like cryptocurrency. These may bring you capital gains, but they do nothing to provide additional cash flow.

Benjamin Graham: He defined investment as an operation that was carried out based on sound principles and had a high probability of success. The high probability of success resulted from the use of sound principles. This makes the principles an investor follows the central driver of profits. The stronger your principles, the higher your overall likelihood of long term profits.
Speculation, according to Graham, was the exact opposite of this. It was carried out using unsound principles and was implemented to earn unrealistic results.

### Options as Investments
The point of these stories is that you need to reassess the idea of a particular instrument being risky simply because of its structure. Options can get extremely complicated, but this depends on the person using them.
The key is to match your abilities with appropriate strategies.
The key isn't to look at what the instrument is but what your investment theses is. Anyone can misuse a tool and cause damage, this isn't the tool's fault.

### Misusing Options
The usual manner in which options are used is to implement them as a part of speculative strategies. Traders make short-term bets using options because they provide a lower cost of entry into the market. Instead of placing a directional bet, they use options to try to profit from the volatility spike that they foresee.
The most common manner in which most speculators trade options is to use them as tools to bet on price movements. If they think the price of a stock is about to rise, they buy call options. If they think it's about to fall, they buy puts. 
It's safe to say none of these directional trades work well consistently.

Since most traders look to buy options, the thing for you as an intelligent investor to do is to write options to them. Most options trades fail because they end up expiring outside the money.

This is the core thesis behind writing covered calls: By writing covered options, you're placing yourself in a position of maximum success since the odds are in your favor right from the start.

### How Many Options Expire Worthless?
A writer might be looking to close out their position by covering their investment (by buying back the option) and capturing the decline in premium. Not every option writer allows their option to expire worthless. Sometimes, short-term volatility drives prices extremely low and they close it out in order to avoid a bounce up in prices prior to expiry.

It's best to begin your options journey using sound investment principles, and this is what we'll be presenting to you throughout the remainder of the book.

### Win Rates and Average Wins
Most speculators don't fully understand the role that win rates and average win amounts play in determining the profitability of a trading system. The average person chases a 100% win rate. In the markets this principle doesn't quite hold up. Having the right answers in the market is no guarantee of making money.

You need to remain invested for the right reasons, irrespective of what the price does. When the reasons change, you need to exit your position even it it's continuing to rise.

On the other hand, investors aren't concerned (or shouldn't be) when the price moves up or down in the short term. Their thesis is the most important thing, so entry and exit depends on that entirely.

An option writer's challenge is to stick to their rules and not get carried away by their regular stream of wins. This is easier said than done.
The key is to keep executing your strategy over and over. Some investors sabotage themselves by demanding excitement. When everything is said and done, the covered call is a pretty boring strategy. It's not exciting and the money you receive will start becoming monotonous.

==Covered Call Rule #4==
>The beauty of the covered call is not that you win big. It's that you win small, and often. Making it a reliable and repeatable income source.
