# Covered Calls for Beginners
## Chapter 1 - Options 101

Most options contracts these days are available on stocks, but there are options available on forex instruments, bonds and interest rate instruments. 

>*A major advantage of options trading is that unlike buy and hold investing, in which you only profit when a stock moves up. Options allow you to profit regardless of if the stock moves up or down, or even if it moves laterally and stays at the same price*

***There are two kinds of options that will be available to you:***
1. **Call Options:** Give the buyer the right, *but not the obligation* to buy the underlying stock at an agreed price, before a certain date. If you choose to not buy the underlying stock, this is perfectly fine. ***Buyers of calls bet on the fact that the price of the underlying stock will increase; call options buyers make money only when the price of the underlying stock increases.***
2. **Put Options:** Puts give you the option to sell the underlying stock. You have the option but no the obligation to sell. Note that you still buy a put despite it giving you the power to sell the underlying stock: you're obtaining the option to short a stock without going on margin.

When used in a smart manner, you can use options to not only provide you with a solid monthly cash flow, you can also use them to *reduce* your risk.

### Where They Trade
The price at which you buy an instrument is the *ask* or *offer* price. 
The price at which you sell an instrument is the *bid*.
Options spreads depend on the liquidity available in the market and on the volatility of the stock itself. The more volatile a stock is, the larger the options price spread will be.
The price of an options contract is called a *premium*, this is because options often function as insurance against adverse market moves.

Options (calls and puts) can be bought or sold.

When you buy a put, you're explicitly stating your opinion that the price of the stock is going to fall. You'll profit only if the price falls. If it moves sideways, you won't make money. However, buy selling a call, you're stating your opinion that the stock will not rise. ***This is different from saying you're betting on a fall.*** Selling a call gives you the ability to profit no matter what happens.

ðŸ’¥One huge advantages of options: They give you the ability to profit even in sideways markets.

#### Superior Cash Flow Opportunities
Options contracts allow you to leverage your investment: they do this in two ways.

1. By the way they're structured: Each option contract covers 100 shares of the underlying stock. Options premiums are usually a fraction of the price of the individual shares so you can control 100 shares by paying a much smaller amount. *Calculating options contract prices: briefly, the price of a contract depends on how long it has until it expires and on the current market price.*
2. Using options to generate cash flow: Covered Calls are a strategy that create this kind of situation.

##### Non-Directional Trading
When options truly shine is when it comes to implementing non-directional trading strategies. Stock prices fall or move sideways; you can use options to profit. Unpredictable movements; you can use options to profit. 
These strategies are called *Volatility Trading Strategies.* 

Investors treat volatility as a known unknown: they may not know in which direction prices will move, but they can say with a degree of certainty that there will be a significant move in one or both directions. Certain options strategies allow you to target the increase or decrease in volatility.

##### Improper Use of Leverage
Options provide you with the ability to leverage your money, and this can create problems. Beginners should stick to simple options strategies, such as writing covered calls.

==Covered Call Rule #2==
> You can make a steady monthly income by only using basic options strategies.

#### Time Decay
Briefly, time decay refers to the event where option premiums (prices) decrease over time. If you're buying an options contract, then time decay means an ill-time purchase could make capturing gains very difficult. 
However, by selling options, which is what you'll be doing with covered calls, you actually use time decay to your advantage.
