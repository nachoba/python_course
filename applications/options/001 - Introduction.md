# Covered Calls for Beginners
## Introduction
### Capital Gains and Cash Flow
Traditionally, we as investors tend to think of our stock market investments in terms of capital gains. While capital gains are undoubtedly the primary drivers of profit in the market, by solely focusing on capital gains, we ignore another source of investment profit: ***cash flow.***

Cash flow provides us with the opportunity to leverage our investment for free. Generally, stock investors rely solely on capital gains and end up focusing on gains that are mostly unrealized. Unrealized meaning that you only receive cash when you sell your investment.

**So what should an investor do?** Do you have to choose between capital gains and cash flows? This is where covered calls comes into the picture.
