## Chapter 2 - The Basics of Options Contracts
Options terminology revolves around the way a contract is structured. Once you understand how the structure works, you'll have no problems grasping what the various terms means.

### Call Options
A ***call*** option gives you the right to buy the underlying security at a certain price. An option's ***strike price*** is the level at which it will make you money. Choosing the right strike price is very important with a call or a put because it determines how far the underlying has to move in order for you to start making money.

Investors buy calls when they're bullish about a stock's prospects. How do you use a call to buy the underlying? The process is called *exercising the option.* Remember that each call options contract covers 100 shares of the underlying.

> ***Example:*** If you exercise a single options contract of Mercado Libre at $2,500 you we'll need to pay $250,000 in cash from your account. 

Over and above this, you'll also need to pay the ***premium*** when you buy the call. The premium is not recoverable under any circumstances. Whether your trade goes for a profit or a loss, you will lose this money. 
Therefore, when exercising or selling a call, you need to make sure you earn at least this much back in order to break even.

The option's premium fluctuates depending on how close the underlying market price is to the strike price. An option's premium has two portions to it: The ***intrinsic value*** and the ***time value*** (also known as extrinsic value). In order to understand how these work, you first need to understand ***expiry dates.***

### Expiry Dates
All options contracts have an expiry date attached to them. This means that whether you want to exercise or sell the option, you need to do that before the expiry date. Let's consider an example:

> Mercado Libre stock is selling for $2,000. You can buy two calls: one with a strike price of $1,900 and another with a strike price of $1,500. Both of these calls expire in the same month, which is 30 days away. Their premium will differ since clearly, they're not worth the same.
> The $1,500 call will make you more money. Its price will be a sum of it *intrinsic value* and its *time value*. The intrinsic value is a straightforward mathematical calculation.
> It's simply the difference between the underlying price and the strike price:
> `Call MELI $1,500 -> $2,000 - $1,500 = $500`
> `Call MELI $1,900 -> $2,000 - $1,900 = $100`

```python
# This program calculates the intrinsinc value of a call option

spot_price   = float(input("Enter the spot price of the stock:"))
strike_price = float(input("Enter the strike price of the option:"))

intrinsic_value = spot_price - strike_price

if (intrinsic_value > 0):
    print(f"The intrinsic value of the call option is {intrinsic_value:.2f}")
else:
    print(f"The call option is out of the money and has no intrinsic value")
```

This leaves us with the time value. Unlike the *intrinsic value*, the *time value* is not as straightforward mathematical calculation. ***The longer and option has until expiration, the more valuable it is.*** The reasoning is that there is more time for the underlying to move into a position where the option can make you money.***The closer it is to expiry, the less value it has, since there is less time for the option to make you money.***
Time value is a constantly changing thing and there is no straightforward method of calculating it. But, the concept of *time value* is far more important for you to understand than calculating the value itself. ***Specifically, you need to understand that time value decreases as the option approaches expiry.*** This phenomenon is called ***time decay.*** 
***Time decay*** usually accelerates once the option is less than 30 days aways from expiry.

ðŸ’¥Some options can be exercised or sold only on the expiry date: these are called ***European*** options. The other type of options, called ***American*** options, can be exercised on any day leading up to the expiry date.

### In and Out of the Money
In the case of a ***call option***, the investor makes money only when the underlying price is greater than the option's ***strike price.*** If an option can make its owner money, it's said to be ***in the money*** or ***ITM.***

When the strike price equals the market price, the option is said to be ***at the money*** or ***ATM.***

When the call option is ***outside the money*** or ***OTM***, the strike price is greater than the market price. In this scenario, the option buyer would lose money if they exercised it; therefore in the case of an ***OTM*** option the *intrinsic value* is zero, and the option has only *time value* attached to it.

With ***OTM*** options, if the underlying price increases past the strike price turning the option ***in the money*** or ***ITM,*** the option premium value will rise accordingly since it will gain *intrinsic value.* Its *time value* will also increase by some amount despite moving closer to expiry since the probability of making money is taken into account in this value.


> ***A Sample Option Trade***
> You spotted a reason for Mercado Libre to increase in value from it current price of $2,000. You think it's going to go past $2,500 over the next two months easily.
> Since you think a target price of $2,500 is probable, you'd want to pick a call with a strike that is less than $2,500 but still leaves you with enough room to earn profit.
> Take a look at the calls and decide that the $2,200 is the right strike price. 
> At this level, the option has no intrinsic value since it's ***OTM.***
> This call costs you $50, you'll pay $5,000 since every options contract controls 100 shares.
> As MELI increases in price, your calls become more valuable. Eventually, with a week remaining until expiry, the underlying sells for $2,400: this results in a $200 gain in intrinsic value per share.
> However, your time value is quickly decreasing since there isn't much time left till expiry.
> At this point, you have two choices:
> 1. Exercise the call and buy 100 shares of MELI at $2,200
> 2. Sell the call and earn profit
> Let's assume that time value declines to zero: that isn't a problem because the call still has an intrinsic value of $200 per share in it.
> Selling the option will result in a credit of $20.000 to your account. You paid $5,000 to buy the call. This leaves you with a profit of $35,000. ***This is the best case scenario.***
> The ***worst case scenario*** for you would be the underlying not moving past your strike price of $2,200. What happens then?
> Your contract will be worthless since it will be ***OTM*** upon expiry. You simple let it expire, and all you lose is your initial $5,000 investment, which is how much you paid to buy the call.


### Put Options
Call options give you the right to buy the stock at a particular price, whereas puts give you the right to sell the underlying at a particular price. Puts tend to confuse new investors a bit since you're effectively shorting the underlying stock, which is not something you'd usually do with regular investing. 
Put options solve the problem of margins.

> ***A Sample Option Trade***
> The terminology associated with puts is the same as it is with calls. It's just that ***ITM*** and ***OTM*** conditions are flipped. Puts make you money when the underlying value is less than the strike price: this is when they're **ITM**,
> For example: If MELI is selling for $2,000 the $1,900 put is **OTM**, and the $2,300 put is **ITM**. In the case of a call, the $1,900 call will be **ITM** and the $2,300 call will be ***OTM.***
> The calculation of *intrinsic value* is also flipped in the case of a put. A put gains *intrinsic value* when the underlying moves lower than the *strike price*. It has no *intrinsic value* as long as the underlying is greater than the strike price. 
> The time value works in the same way as it does with a call.
> So, you think MELI's price will decline to $1,800. Instead of shorting the stock, you buy puts with a strike price of $1,900. If MELI declines to $1,800 you will earn a profit of $100 per share, or $10,000 per contract. 
> If the put expires ***OTM*** you'll lose only the premium you paid for the put.

We'd like to point out once again that you'll be buying the put, not shorting it. You can short or write a put, but that's not what's going on here. If you wish to benefit from a decline in prices, you buy a put.

```python
# This program calculates the intrinsinc value of a put option

spot_price   = float(input("Enter the spot price of the stock:"))
strike_price = float(input("Enter the strike price of the option:"))

intrinsic_value = strike_price - spot_price

if (intrinsic_value > 0):
    print(f"The intrinsic value of the put option is {intrinsic_value:.2f}")
else:
    print(f"The put option is out of the money and has no intrinsic value")
```

### Buying and Writing Options
Selling an option is also called writing an option. This is why you'll often see the covered call strategy referred to as "writing covered calls". The buyer of the option has a choice for exercising it or not. The option writer, however, has no choice. If the buyer chooses to exercise the option, the writer/seller has to deliver.

This makes option writing a bit riskier than buying an option. The option buyer knows there is no obligation, but the option writer needs to construct their trade in such a way that they eliminate any risk.

With good risk management, you'll make more money with less risk writing options than buying them. In fact, covered calls are essentially risk-free, because writing the option itself doesn't increase your risk profile.

### Writing a Put
Writing a put can be risky. Why write puts instead of buy calls? 
This highlights an important difference between writing an option and buying one: *When you buy an option, you're marrying yourself to the strike price.* You need to be able to predict not just the strike price that will make you money but also the time it will take the underlying to move past that strike.
Writing a put allows to divorce from the stock having to move past a particular strike price. What we effectively are saying is that the stock price will not fall below certain level over the expiry period of the put. ***This is very different from saying the price will definitely rise past a certain strike price (which is the case if we bought a call).***


==Covered Call Rule #3==
>Whether you write a put or call option, you always get paid the premium upfront and get to keep it regardless of whether or not the option finishes in the money.

But what happens if the options moves ***ITM*** and you're hit with an exercise from the option buyer? This process is called and ***assignment.*** If you're ***assigned*** an option, it means the buyer has exercised the option and you need to deliver.
In the case of a put, the buyer is seeking to sell the stock. This means you'll have to buy the underlying at the strike price of the put. You'll have to hold onto these shares or sell ti immediately for a loss; it's up to you.

The price of a stock can go all the way to zero. This means your maximum risk on the trade is equal to the strike price of the put (strike price minus zero). Writing a put is therefore not something anyone can do.

### Writing a Call
If writing a put is risky, writing calls is one of the riskiest things you can do. This is because the price of a stock can rise till infinity. But the risk has to do with the type of calls we are writing. 
There is an easy way to eliminate the risk of writing a call. It's by already holding the stock you are writing the calls against. This way, you profit both from the upside movement of the stock, and from the premium you received by writing the option. It's a win-win scenario and why the covered call is such a great options strategy.

### Option Chains
Another item you'll need to become familiar with is the option chain. The ***option chain*** is just a visual representation of which options are available for you to buy or write at a particular time.

![[001-figure001.png]]

The page shows the bid and ask prices of each option at the different strike prices. In addition to this, some other information could be shown such as implied volatility, volumes and open interest. Volume is the same thing as with stocks, which is to say they indicate the number of contracts being traded.

Implied volatility is denoted by the Greek letter sigma $\sigma$ or $\Sigma$. It is expressed as a percentage or in terms of a standard deviation number and indicates how much the stock is likely to move in the near future. A higher implied volatility value indicates that the stock is going to be more volatile. You should also note that ***volatility is not directional***, so higher volatility does not mean a stock will definitely move up or down. It is a measure of the amount it could move in either direction.

==Covered Call Rule #4==
>Implied volatility is always non-directional

Implied volatility should not be confused with historical volatility or beta. Beta indicates how volatile the stock has been in the past. Implied volatility is concerned with the near future. Also note the implied volatility can be divorced from the overall market volatility. 
The market's volatility is captured by the volatility index $VIX$. Unless you are writing calls on indexes rather than stocks, your focus should be on implied volatility of that particular stock, rather than the $VIX$.

### Summary
+ Options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specific price.
+ You can use options if you think the price of an asset will rise, fall or stay the same.
+ A call option gives you the right to buy an asset at a fixed price.
+ A put options gives you the right to sell an asset at a fixed price.
+ The price you pay for an options contract is called the premium.
+ You pay the premium regardless of the outcome of the contract.
+ The price of the option premium is made up of two factors:
+ Intrinsic value: The difference between the price of the underlying and how far the option is in the money.
+ If the option is out of the money, then the premium has no intrinsic value.
+ Time value (or extrinsic value), is the amount of time left in the options contract.
+ All options are fixed time contracts, which have a specific expiry date.
+ When you use your options contracts to buy the asset at the agreed price, this is known as exercising the contract.
+ You must exercise the contract before the expiry date.
+ 1 option contract covers 100 shares of the underlying asset.
+ You can also sell (or write) options.
+ When you sell an options contract, you receive the premium upfront and get to keep it no matter what.
+ The covered call is a strategy which involves selling call options on a stock you already own.
+ You get paid the premium upfront, as well as benefitting if the price of your stock rises.

### Exercises
1. Using the bid price, how much would it cost you to buy 1 call options contract for TSLA at the $455 strike?
`The bid @ $455 strike is $77.60. One contract is 100 shares so the cost would be  100 x $77.60 = $7,760`

2. Using the ask price, how much would you receive if you sold 1 call options contracts for TSLA at the $460 strike?
`The ask @ $460 strike is $79.70. One contract is 100 share so the cost would be  100 x $79.70 = $7,960`

3. The options in figure 1 have 60 days to expiry. All other things being equal, would the price of these options be higher or lower in 30 days time?
`There would be lower because of Time Decay -> The time value or extrinsic value.`

4. TSLA traded at $442.50 when figure 1 was printed. The price of the call option at the $420 strike is $92. How much of this $92 is intrinsic value, and how much is time value?
`Intrinsic value = Stock Price - Strike -> $442.50 - $420.00 = $22.50 / Then, the time value is the difference: $92.00 - $22.50 = $69.50`
Remember, only ***ITM*** options have intrinsic value. Because intrinsic value cannot be negative, ***OTM*** options only consists of time value.
