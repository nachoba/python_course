    "### An Overview of Statistical Learning\n",
    "*Statistical Learning* refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools can be classified as:\n",
    "1. Supervised learning\n",
    "2. Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Boradly speaking, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an *output* based on one or more *inputs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "With unsupervised learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide an illustration of some applications of statistical learning, we briefly discuss three real-world data sets that are considered in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wage Data\n",
    "In this dataset `Wage`, we examine a number of factors that relate to wages for a group of men from the Atlantic region of the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to understand the association between an employee's `age` and `education`, as well as the calendar `year`, on his `wage`. "
