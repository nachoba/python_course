### Comments
A *comment* allows you to write notes in your spoken language, within your programs. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter.

```python
# this is the typical comment

equation = 2 * a + b ** 2        # another comment
```

The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work. Especially for future reference.

### The Zen of Python
There is a set of principles when programming in Python, you can see them

```python {cmd}
import this
```
```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
Let's analyze some of them:

Python's programmers embrace the notion that code can be beautiful and elegant.
* *Simple is better than complex:* If you have a choice between a simple and complex solution, and both work, use the simple solution.
* *Complex is better than complicated:* If a simple solution to a problem is unattainable, use the simplest solution that works.
* *Readability counts:* Even when your code is complex, aim to make it readable. When you're working on a project that involves complex coding, focus on writing informative comments.
* *There should be one $-$and preferably only one$-$ obvious way to do it:* Much of programming consists of using small, common approaches to simple situations within a large project.
* *Now is better than never:* Don't try to write the perfect code; write code that works, and then decide whether to improve your code.
