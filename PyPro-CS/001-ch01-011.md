# Chapter 1 :: Computer and Programs

## 1.1 The Universal Machine

Have you ever stopped to wonder what exactly a computer is? How can one device perform so many different tasks? These basic questions are the starting point for learning about computers and computer programming.

A modern computer can be defined as *"a machine that stores and manipulates information under the control of a changeable program"*. 
We have two key points here:
1. *Computers are devices for manipulating information*
2. *Computers operate under the control of a changeable program*

A ***computer program*** is detailed, step-by-step set of instructions telling a computer exactly what to do. If we change the program, then the computer performs a different sequence of actions, and hence, performs a different task. The machine stays the same, but the program controlling the machine changes.

One of the remarkable discoveries of computer science is the realizaiton that all of these different computers have the same power; with suitable programming, each computer can basically do all the things that any other computer can do. ***This is the concept of Universal Machine.***
