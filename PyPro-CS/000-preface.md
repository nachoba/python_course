# Preface

## How to Read this Book

1. **Chapters 1-4:** should be read in order.
2. **Chapter 5:** can be divided: "Sequences" is fundamental, the rest can be treated later.
3. **Chapters 6-8:** can be read independently. The order does not matter.
4. **Chapter 9-12:** should be read in order. If the focus is on OOP, only skim through chapter 9.
5. **Chapter 11:** can be moved earlier if Data Collections are needed.
6. **Chapter 13:** the contents could be interspersed at various places.
